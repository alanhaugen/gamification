There are only a certain amount of topics which need to be covered in game design.

Steven is lecturing. He is an artistic academic with a bunch of students. He looks at game design and examines what game design can do and what it is. He subjects game design to difficult challenges. The more challenges they accomplish and fail, the more you know about that character.

He is bold and half-rude. He wants the worst problems, wicked problems, problems which become exponentially difficult the more someone tries to solve it. One has to think algorithmically. It tells us a lot about game design. The literature and game studies will give you a lot.

Most members of the UEPXRE group are here at Hamar. Many of them are international students. They do in-house game design. They follow up things and make an infrastructure to make and test games. 

They have made a game making platform. They are using Unreal 5.

Game development conferences have a todo list. They have the 400's list.

Homo Ludens is one of the first books about about play (games?).

The magic circle. Is mentioned in Rules of Play. A polar bear might prefer play over eating a dog. Playing is about affordances. It is not about rehearsing life. Play -> Games -> Gamification. You can win a game (rules + desired outcome), but you can't win in play.

Toys are contextual affordances for playing. "A toy car rolls forwards not sideways".

In game design, one focuses a lot of game mechanics, but think of it last not first. You create game mechanics by creating everything else. Eating fish at a campfire is a nice moment, but you do all sorts of stuff to make a good fish (and that is the game mechanics).

What is your game doing? Who is it for?

An affordance is not always a game mechanic, but a game mechanic is always an affordance. 

A guitar gives you affordances, playing it is a mechanic (varying skill).

You can make a game harder with constraints (a constraint is making a mechanic harder)

If things are not voluntary you risk making people hostages.


# Assignment

Find the most essential aspect of the game play
and gamified actions in your game

What are the main affordances, mechanics, goals and constraints?


Our game, LexiBocks, is all about learning languages!

The most essential aspect of the game play is learning, to add tetrominos which add up into words, and fill ones personal dictionary of words.
